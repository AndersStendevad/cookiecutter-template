## Project Description

This is a generic template for setting up a software project. It includes basic
setup and configuration files, as well as templates for various components
commonly found in software projects, such as READMEs, LICENCE and
documentation. You can use this template to quickly set up a new project.

I personally use this as a base template for my other cookiecutters.

This includes:

- **mkdocs**
- **revealjs**
- **README.md**
- **LICENCE**
- **Generic project structure**

## Getting Started

Before you start, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your
system:

- Git
- cookiecutter

## Usage

To create a new project using this template, run the following command in the
cloned directory:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/AndersStendevad/cookiecutter-template.git
```

This will prompt you for any necessary input, such as the project name and
description. After providing the required information, the script will generate
a new project.
